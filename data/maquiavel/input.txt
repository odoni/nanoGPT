How many types are the teams and what ways are assumed by leaders In this chapter, we will explore the nature of the teams and the ways in which the leaders take them.

Understanding these matters is fundamental to those seeking to exercise leadership wisely and effectively.

Since ancient times, men have always gathered around a leadership figure, whether to protect themselves from external threats or to achieve common goals.

It is through leadership that shapes and guides the direction of a team.

But, after all, how many guys are the teams? Is there only one form of leadership or are they present in many ways? That's what we'll talk about next.

Throughout this chapter, we will dive into the depths of human nature, analyzing the different forms of leadership and their respective advantages and disadvantages.

We will find that, like people, teams also have their own personalities and that it is up to the leader to find the most appropriate way to lead them.

Assuming the leadership of a team is a task that requires courage, determination and above all humility.

One must be attentive to the challenges and have the wisdom to face them wisely.

This chapter will be a valuable guide for all those who seek to exercise leadership effectively and transformatively.

Hey leader, I usually see people trying to please you with expensive things or that they think you like, like tickets to events, courses, travels, gifts, and other cool things.

I wanted to offer something that I really value, so I decided to offer you the knowledge that I have acquired over the years, studying the actions of great leaders, both ancient and modern.

I summarized everything in a small book and am giving you the opportunity to learn everything I learned.

If you think that's not good enough, I understand, but I believe that's all I can offer.

I did not add elaborate phrases or difficult words, because I want it to be appreciated by your substance, not by your style.

I don't want you to think I'm arrogant for giving advice on leadership.

To understand people, you need to be one of them and to understand the leader, you need to be in power.

So please accept this gift with good intentions and I hope it will bring you lots of luck and greatness.

In all organizations, all sectors that have already exercised and still exercise power over their employees, have been and are managed by directors and managers.

Management teams are or were formed by succession, when the position is occupied by professionals who have long been working in that area, or are new.

The new management teams, or are entirely new, such as when a whole new area is formed or are added to an existing management team.

These acquired managerial teams, or are accustomed to working under a centralized management, or are accustomed to teamwork and are conquered through their own effort or by the efforts of others, through luck or skill.

I'll put aside the discussion about other management models, because I've talked about it before.

I will focus on management, and continue to build the strategies I have mentioned, and examine how these managements can be conducted and maintained.

Areas that have a succession of stable managers and that employees are accustomed to working together, there are fewer challenges to keep the area leadership than in teams with new managers.

It is enough to keep the order established by the previous team and deal with the challenges that arise.

So if the management team is capable, they will always keep the business unless an external force will interfere.

Even in this case, the team can regain control regardless of the power of external force.

The management team has fewer reasons and need to oppress their employees, so if they do not have harmful behaviors, they are likely to be loved by the team.

The stability and continuity of the management team makes people forget how it all started, so any change always leaves room for other changes.
